# ToDoAppWithReact
Project #3 for the Quickstart Web Development Bootcamp

Developer: Larry Hodges

Description: I created a ToDo/Task Manager App and a Feedback/Contact form. Both Apps are on a single page linked with React Router. 

Technologies used: React, Node.js, JSX, Router, HTMl, CSS, Google Fonts, and Bitmoji

Ideas for future improvement: 

- Better organization of my Components and Pages
- Learn how to link my Frontend project to the Backend
- Make App more Mobile Friendly
